This guide serves as an overview of the basics and tools of the SAS programming language that we tended to use at Opportunity Insights when working with large administrative Census datasets. It assumes zero prior knowledge about SAS but some knowledge of basic programming principles. 

This guide was compiled from previous versions contributed to by: Danny Onorato, Benny Goldman, Ben Scuderi, Sarah Abraham, Alex Bell, Jamie Fogel, Trevor Bakker, Kaveh Danesh, Danny Yagan, and Emmanuel Saez.
