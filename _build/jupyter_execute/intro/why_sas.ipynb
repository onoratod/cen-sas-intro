    "# Why SAS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code in SAS can be frustrating. It is likely not the type of statistical programming language you are accustomed to using. Programs like Stata and R store data in random access memory (RAM) — SAS operates on a single row of data at a time. This is what makes SAS useful for working with large datasets — you do not have to read the full file into memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Stata, you can use other parts of the data to inform \"row-level\" operations. For example, if you have a variable $x$ and you want to generate \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = x − \\overline{x}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "you can use the `egen` function to attach $\\overline{x}$ as a wide variable or simply summarize $x$ and difference out the mean using the stored macro. Conversely, SAS cannot compute the sample mean, $\\overline{x}$, in a standard `DATA` step operation (more on this later) because it only has a single line of the data held in memory. A simple way to think about SAS is as a for-loop executing commands on each row of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "forval i = 1/_N {\n",
    "    replace x = x + 1 if _n == `i'\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAS programmer is required to write linear and purposeful code because of this \"row-by-row functionality.\" This forces you to think through every operation you are asking SAS to perform. That is why SAS is like spinach. \n",
