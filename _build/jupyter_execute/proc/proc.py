# SAS Procedures

SAS has many pre-packaged PROCEDURES for completing various statistical analyses and database management or manipulation tasks. Generally, these PROCEDURES perform computations or tasks that would be burdensome or practically impossible in a traditional `DATA` step. Every data-manipulating step other than a `DATA` step in a SAS program is a `PROCEDURE`, shortened to `PROC` in SAS lingo. In this section, we go over a few of our most commonly used SAS PROCEDURES. 

All SAS PROCEDURES are terminated with a `quit;` as opposed to the `run;` used in `DATA` steps.
