    "# Macro Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the final component of a program header are the program-specific macro variables. SAS macro variables allow you to modify the text in a SAS program through symbolic substitution (think `local` and `global` from Stata). SAS macro variables are declared by a `%LET` statement followed by the macro name, an equals sign, and finally the value to be stored in the macro. You can store anything in a SAS macro. \n",

    "```sas\n",
    "%let fcohort = 1978;\n",
    "%let lcohort = 1991;\n",
    "%let file_name = example.txt;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To refer to a previously declared SAS macro variable, you type the macro name (i.e. fcohort) contained by `&` and `.`. For example, to keep rows of data for kids born between 1978-1991 using the macro variables above, we would write:\n",

    "## A note on the use of `&` and `.` with Macros and Nested Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we discuss macro processing in more detail, you should skip this portion for now and come back when useful. In general, there is no need to include the `.` delimiter at the end of the macro name when envoking a SAS macro variable - the `&` will suffice. For example the sampe code above will work without the periods: \n",
    "\n",
    "```sas\n",
    "if cohort >= &fcohort and cohort <= &lcohort;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times, however, when the `.` is required to delimit the end of a macro variable so it is good practice to include them. For example, when using macro variables nested within text or code, the `.` is needed to signify the end of the macro variable. This is illustrated below:"

By that I mean we will first invoke `pre1` and `pre2` to so that we can then invoke `fyear`, `lyear` and finally `mean_cpi_1998_1999`. The easiest way to figure this is out is to start from the end and work backwards (each time we go up we add an ampersand). The last reference we want to be resolved is \n",
