    "Given that our code can take several hours or days to run, we often want to be sure that our code will work and produce what we want. To do this we can set `OBS=0` or `OBS=N` to read in the first `N` observations of each dataset. This allows the code to run incredibly fast, which allows us to address syntax errors and confirm the final data includes everything we want among other things. If you are merging datasets in your code, the final dataset may appear empty because it is unlikely that the first `N` observations have the same merge keys between the two datasets. \n",
